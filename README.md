Welcome to the official repository of Jians Website, a platform dedicated to providing high-quality math tutoring services. This repository hosts the code and resources used for the website, which aims to connect students with effective math tutoring, tailored to their unique learning needs.

## Overview

My name is [Your Name], and I am a Computer Science major at UC Riverside with over five years of experience as a math tutor, specifically teaching middle school students. My passion for teaching math, combined with my expertise in calculus and writing, enables me to help students build a strong foundation and develop effective problem-solving skills.

## About Me

As a committed and passionate student, I have always enjoyed deciphering challenging mathematical concepts and sharing this knowledge through teaching. Being at UC Riverside, I am surrounded by technology and statistics, which enhances my tutoring approach. My educational background equips me with the skills to communicate complex ideas in a manner that is both understandable and engaging for my students.

## Math Tutoring Services

I specialize in a range of mathematics topics, from basic arithmetic to higher-level calculus. Each tutoring session is designed to be interactive and supportive, creating an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions:

- **Key Areas of Focus:**
  - Foundational math subjects: Geometry, Algebra, and Trigonometry
  - Higher-level calculus concepts
  - Problem-solving strategies tailored to individual learning styles

I aim to build confidence in my students by breaking down difficult topics into manageable parts, ensuring they grasp the fundamental concepts before moving forward.

## The Tutoring Process

My tutoring process is structured and personalized, starting with an evaluation of each studentâ€™s unique strengths and areas for improvement. Here's how it works:

1. **Assessment:** Initial evaluation to gauge the student's current level of mastery in mathematics and writing.
2. **Customized Plan:** Development of a structured plan that includes targeted exercises, practice problems, and writing assignments.
3. **Open Communication:** Encouragement of feedback and open communication, allowing students to express their challenges.
   
This collaborative approach not only enhances academic performance but also nurtures a love for learning.

## My Interests

Beyond tutoring, I am passionate about technology and software development. I often explore projects that integrate my programming skills with mathematical applications. Additionally, I enjoy creative writing as an outlet for self-expression. My free time includes participating in local math competitions, volunteering for educational outreach programs, and engaging in outdoor activities that help me unwind and stay inspired.
